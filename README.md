 #### -main.js:
 ##### File that controls the game, startup and the draw function
 #### -ball.js:
 ##### Class file that contains ball class.
 #### -wall.js:
 ##### Class file that contains wall class.
 #### -neat.js:
 ##### file that controls the genetric algorithm.

 ## Libraries:
 - [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) Controls the drawing of the scene.
 - [neataptic.js](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic) Controls the genetic algorithm and neural network math.
 - [p5.collide2D](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D) Detects collisions so i didn't have to check for them myself.
