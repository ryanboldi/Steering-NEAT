    <p>
        <font size="+1"><b>What is steering evolution?</b></font><br>Well, it is a project I created to see if i could
        train neural networks to steer around obsticles to reach a final goal.

        <font size="+1"><b>What are the creatures?</b></font><br>I'm glad you asked. <i>Balls</i> are creatures that
        have a brain with 4 inputs, and 2 outputs:

    <p><b>The 4 inputs are: </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Sight from left eye</li>
            <li>Sight from middle eye</li>
            <li>Sight from right eye</li>
            <li>Angle to goal</li>
        </ul>
        <b>The 2 outputs are:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Probability to turn left</li>
            <li>Probability to turn right</li>
        </ul>
        If either of the probabilities are above 0.5, the creature would turn in that respective direction.
